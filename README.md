# ADHD-Prediction

The aim of this project is to develop an AI-based system for detecting ADHD using eye gaze
tracking. The technology will be designed to analyze individuals' eye movements and patterns
accurately to identify potential ADHD symptoms. The project will involve collecting eye gaze
data from a diverse sample of participants, including those with and without ADHD, to train and
validate the AI algorithm. The system will prioritize ease of use and have a high level of
accuracy in detecting ADHD. Additionally, the study will explore the potential of the system as a
screening tool for ADHD in clinical settings. Ultimately, this project aims to leverage AI and eye
gaze tracking technology to create a powerful new tool for ADHD diagnosis.
